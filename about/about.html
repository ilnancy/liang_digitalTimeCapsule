            Nancy is a Senior majoring in Visual Communication Design at San Francisco State University. 
            She was born on July 15th, 2002, in Fremont, California. She has two siblings: an older sister 
            and a twin brother.  She has always been influenced in creating art because of her relatives.
            Especially her Mom because she would watch her paint, draw, fruit carve, etc. Nancy took summer art
            classes and as well as went to her Uncle's art studio to create various art when she was young. Nancy 
            stopped creating art until she switched majors to Graphic Design. She has been diving into her creativity
            and became interested in learning more about digital art. Though, she is still new to this field, she
            is excited to see what career path she is pursuing.

                In her free-time, Nancy loves baking desserts because she has a sweet-tooth. She loves cats where she 
                would go out of her way to meet any cat she gets the chance to. Nancy would go to shelters to say "hello" to cats. 
                She adopted all her cats from a shelter. She loves spending time and playing with her cats. Three cats are living with 
                her in San Francisco. Her cat's names are Taro (2 years old), Mew (1 year old), and Meeko (1 year old). Her cat Matcha
               (2 years old) lives with my twin brother back in Fremont. Nancy is obsessed with anything purple-related. She likes 
               to occasionally dye her hair herself. She adds a pop of color whenever she can.

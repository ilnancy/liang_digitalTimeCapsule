        <p>
          Nancy would spend the majority of her day scrolling on social media unfortunately.
          This leads to her screen time really high but she enjoys going on Instagram and Tiktok
          the most. Her feed consists of food, makeup tutorials, fashion, nails or cat videos. She
          likes to utilize inspo from her for you page as well. Such as looking at nail inspo for her new 
          set of nails she does herself.

      <p>
        Nancy likes to shop online rather than in-person. Whenever she gets deals or discounts,
        she would look online and find brands to shop. She came across this website called
        Miss A that is located in Texas. It is a Korean-owned business. Nancy loves this website
        because it is affordable and she would buy her essentials from this website. Almost 
        everything is $1! They sell makeup, home essentials, stationary and many more.

      <p>
        Nancy is scared of anything horror but she would watch horror films or games
        to unwind at night with her boyfriend. It is part of her routine despite how 
        scared she is of getting nightmares.
